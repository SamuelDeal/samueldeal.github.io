{"name":"Bulk softwares","tagline":"Personal projects, mostly in progress","body":"## Welcome to my home page.\r\n\r\nThere'ra some projects I'm working on.\r\n\r\nHere the description of my (unfinished) softwares\r\n\r\n### Sugar\r\n\r\nThis is my toy language. The main idea is to provide a low level language, with a modern syntax, and compile-time metaprogramming.\r\nIt should be run with an interpreter or compiled (easy to achieve with llvm).\r\n\r\nMain inspiring languages:\r\n- C++ (oh yeah ! <3 <3 <3)\r\n- Rust (RAII and owner is the way to go)\r\n- Python (hight level API, cool syntax)\r\n- Ruby (cool syntax too)\r\n\r\n[Here the Sugar repository](https://github.com/SamuelDeal/Sugar)\r\n\r\nIt's really at the early stage. Here an example of what it can do already:\r\n```\r\nInt a = 5\r\nwhile a < 10\r\n  echo a++\r\n\r\na = 5\r\nwhile a < 10 {\r\n        echo ++a\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis project may be renamed **Silk**.\r\n\r\nI like this new name because the pronouciation reminds C, and it follow the trend to use materials' names (like perl, ruby, ...).\r\n\r\nAnd I was working on this project while planning my Silk road trip ^^\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Chapi\r\n\r\nIt's the project I'm working on currently.\r\n\r\nIt's a device designed to control [Black Magic Design](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com) devices.\r\n\r\nIt's based on Raspberry Pi and [buildroot](http://buildroot.uclibc.org/) for the device side,\r\nand on Qt on the configuration manager side, so the configuration manager could easily be ported on many platforms.\r\n\r\nAs it will be used in professional world, it will soon have a more polish state.\r\n\r\n[Here the device repository](https://github.com/SamuelDeal/chapi)\r\n\r\n[Here the configuration manager repository](https://github.com/SamuelDeal/chapi_server)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Carpi\r\n\r\nIt's a car radio rpoject based on [mpd](http://www.musicpd.org/) and the raspberry py.\r\n\r\nThis project is paused since I don't have a car anymore ^^.\r\n\r\nBut I may restart it if I get a new truck\r\n\r\n[Here the carpi repository](https://github.com/SamuelDeal/carpi)\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
